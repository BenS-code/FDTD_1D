Finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulation in 1D and 2D for photonics applications.
Several structures are implemented including:
- Dispersive slab
- Distributed Bragg reflector
- Distributed Bragg transmission filter
- guided mode resonance filter (GMRF)
- Metalic guided mode resonance filter
- gratings
- Fano resonance
- Multi-fano resonance
- plasmonic grating
- periodic plasmonic cylinder
- Time dependent slab
